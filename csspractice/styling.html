 <p class="par">How would you describe the home you grew up in?

        Was it a place full of love, stories and cherished memories? 
        For some that was the case, and for others it was quite the opposite. 
        We can all agree, the direction of our life was significantly shaped by those early years. 
        Today, as a parent we feel the weight of that responsibility for our own children.
         The formidable years of our children’s lives are being lived right now–under our roof.
        
        How can we best prepare them for the future? The Bible is very clear.
         We need to raise them up in the way of the Lord. 
         A child’s biblical worldview is strongly shaped between 3-14 years of age. 
         Our Family Discipleship HomeKit can help you get started on the journey to helping your children fall madly in love with Christ.
        
        Have a passion to raise your children in the Lord, this Victorious Family Home Kit resource is designed for you.
